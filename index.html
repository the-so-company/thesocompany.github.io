                  <p>Beth Potts cut her wordsmithing teeth at a variety of Seattle companies, including Microsoft, Seattle Magazine, and Perkins Coie law firm. She launched her online editorial career in the early days of dot-com start-ups, when editorial conversations were becoming as much about the customer experience and functionality — how to word buttons on a website so that customers would click — as about editing — correcting grammatical stumbles, inserting Oxford commas, and sniffing out typos. Following a lengthy stint as copy chief at Amazon.com managing a team of editors, Beth retreated to her home office and dove back into the detailed work of editing manuscripts.  She returned to Amazon as copy chief of Amazon Publishing in 2013, then joined the So Company in July of 2015.</p>

                  <p>Beth lives in Seattle, where she grows arugula and tomatoes in the summer and likes to run up long sets of stairs with her dog for exercise, rain or shine.</p>
