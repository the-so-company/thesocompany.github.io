# Vets.gov onboarding
## [Your team name here]

Hiya! Welcome to the Vets.gov team! New terms and systems will start flying fast in 3...2...1.

So, we’ve created this quick guide to get you started, but also to serve as a reference in the future. You are always welcome to ask any member of the team questions: We all remember the first hour (okay, day), where we stared at the screen wondering where to start, even after going through some training. 

This guide is meant to get you through that hour, but also to backfill you on the basics as you onboard to the team. There will likely be some slow moments as you wait for the team to assign you your first project. That’s a great time to check out the style guide, learn a bit more about what each of the teams do, and generally check out the site so you’ll be familiar with design and style when you get started. 

If you have questions as you’re onboarding, please be sure to let one of us know so we can update this document. 

## HR basics:

You should already have your email account set up, but here are some other things you’ll need as you begin your work. 

**Guideline**

[Check out your 401k.](https://my.guideline.com)

## Onboarding:

Before you ever start work on a project, please do the following:  

- Get on Slack and added to at least #vetsdotgov, [your team's slack here], and any channel for project(s) you will be working on. You can ask your manager for help with this.
- Get added to the department-of-veterans-affairs GitHub organization. Everyone needs to be added to the "Vets.gov Engineers" team. 
	- USDS HQ folks should also be added to the "US Digital Service HQ" team. 
	- DSVA folks should also be added to the "Digital Service at VA" team.
	- Ad Hoc folks should also be added to the "Ad Hoc - General" team.
	- So Company folks should also be added to the So Company Slack's Vets.gov team.
- Make sure you can see the vets.gov [Zenhub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/boards).  This is how we do sprint planning, with filtering by label.
	- You can also download the [Zenhub Browser Extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) for Chrome or Mozilla.
- Get added to all **recurring** (and non-recurring) meeting invites (it's easy for someone to forward the non-recurring version, so make sure you see future weeks on your calendar as well). These meeting invites include but may not be limited to:
	- [meeting]
	- [meeting]
	- [meeting]
	- Your team's sprint planning meeting as well as your team's standups during the week. 

## PIV card:

The PIV card allows you access to VA email, buildings and programs. It's a long, hard, slog of paperwork and waiting, but keep your chin up! Ask for help. Expect delays. Keep asking after it.   
 
 - VA and USDS HQ employees, please talk to your buddy about this (if you don't have a buddy, please talk to your lead, who should help find you a buddy). 
 - Ad Hoc/subcontractor employees, please work with Neal Sherwood to complete this. 
 - [Take a look at the onboarding checklist to make sure you're on track](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/448948ee5c4971496f9e8fda254a343bbc34a76d/Work%20Practices/Onboarding%20and%20Offboarding/Vendor%20Onboarding/Onboarding%20checklist.md) (UPDATE THIS WITH NEW INFO FROM NEAL. ADD NEAL's EMAIL)
  - Should you get a PIV card, you’ll also get a VA email address. If you don't receive an email about your account, it may be because the email went to your new VA email account that you don't yet have access to. (No, really.) IF THAT HAPPENS, CHECK THIS OUT

## On Call (If this applies to your team, edit, please. If not, please delete.)

We require some teams to have people on-call in case of any emergencies. If this applies to you, please: 

- Request a PagerDuty account by creating a GitHub issue in vets.gov-team and ask in [#sre](https://dsva.slack.com/sre/) for someone to take it. 
 - Then contact your [team lead](/Work%20Practices/VetsGov_OrgChart.pptx) to plan your [On Call](/Work%20Practices/Engineering/OnCall) schedule.

## Slack

You’ll receive an invitation for the general So Company Slack. This is where you’ll learn about internal company issues, such as new health insurance policies or notes about things we find interesting. Feel free to say hello or to post anything you find interesting that might apply to what other employees are doing. For example, if you discover an easy way to do something or find a fascinating article about teleworking, spread the love!

Visit So Company’s Slack. 

You’ll also receive an invitation from Vets.gov for the project Slack. That includes people from So Company, as well as people from other contracting companies and VA employees.

Visit the Vets.gov team’s Slack. 

After you’ve set up Slack, you’ll want to make sure you’re on the appropriate product slack teams.

Find the list of Slack teams.

For meetings:

Please download the joinme.com app so you can participate in our weekly meetings. This is where So Company meetings happen, as well as any meetings you conduct for clients. Please download the free version—So Company has hosting names and logins. 

While it is possible to join a meeting from a browser, we’ve found that sometimes the screens don’t keep up with the meetings. And, we can “pass the screen” with this app, so you can show what is on your computer. To do that, you need the app.
Download the JoinMe app (recommended), or
Join a meeting online

And, the folks at Adhoc have put together a guide to look at before you share your screen to a group. It some seemingly obvious things, such as turning off your notifications so you’re not dinging your way through a presentation or so no one sees your personal Slack messages about how irritated your boss is with his cat right now. But it also talks about audio quality and how to make your screen less busy.

Check out tips for sharing your screen.

There are also some tips for participating in remote meetings.

Read tips for participating in remote meetings.

And you’ll probably, during those first couple of meetings, wonder who in the heck all of these people are. 
Check out the (slightly outdated) list of your teammates.

Check out the organization chart that shows where everybody fits.

Getting started:

We’ve put together a list of things to look at as you train—just to get a taste of our style and how we operate. 

Content team repository:

Generally, the content team has a specific repository for our stuff. It’s a great place to start in your training to a) get to know our style, as well as why we do things the way we do thing, and b) just get a general sense of what’s available and where we keep it. 

Visit the Content Team Repository

Important things you’ll find within the repository:

Style Guide

Plain Language Checklist

Content Strategy Guide

VA Contact List

Copy-editing checklist

Markdown Cheat sheet: 

If you haven’t used markdown before, this is a good place to get an idea of how to format headlines, bold bits of text or make a bullet.
Take a look at the cheat sheet. 

We also have our own markdown guide that explains formatting for Github within Vets.gov.
Visit the Vets.gov MD and HTML guide.

If you’re building a page from scratch, you’ll often need to copy-and-paste code from other pages.
Find examples of elements to copy-and-paste.  


Vets.gov Code of Conduct

We don’t discriminate or harass, and we’re inclusive. 
Find out how to (and how not to) act.

Kudos to griffins riding unicorns…or a guide to Vets.gov teams

It’s pretty nerdy up in here. Everyone fairly freely admits it. So here’s a description of our teams:

Nebula: Overall Vets.gov content and hardening (by “hardening,” we mean constantly improving the site so it’s more user-friendly). 

Rainbows: Creates and builds forms and tools. Content team provides content support (writing and editing)
Some examples of the tools the team works on:
•      Education, Health Care, Pension/Burial forms
•      686 Dependents form
•      VIC application
•      email messaging (new initiative)
Find out more about Rainbows
Unicorns: Creates and builds forms and tools. Content team provides content support (writing and editing)
Some examples of the tools the team works on:

Kudos Team:
•      Improve the sign-in experience
Find out more about Kudos


Stuff you’ll need every day:

If you haven’t used these tools, they can seem a bit overwhelming at first—just like every time the newsroom decides to use new software, the first time you tried to figure out Wordpress, or the time, back in the day, when you learned Photoshop. Or something. But eventually, those things became easy, and so will this. The team does a lot of cutting-and-pasting of code; the challenge is feeling confident about where you’re putting it. Unless, of course, this is all old hat to you, in which case, sweet. Go forth and make sentences. 

Zenhub:

Zenhub has a lot going on, and the first time going in to look at workflow can be disconcerting, at best. This quick guide to workflow should help. The workflow page contains much more information about products, who’s in charge of teams and where you can find more information about the teams. You’ll get an invitation to join.

After you get the invitation, visit this page.
Visit online and scroll down toward the bottom to find out more.

Visit our Zenhub site.

Things you’ll need to know right off the bat: 

At the top of the Zenhub page, you can search under “assignees” to find yourself. This is the work you’ve been assigned. Ad Hoc has also created a page the shows how our team uses Zenhub.

Take a look at how Vets.gov uses Zenhub.

Issues within Github contain several fields:
•	Title: One-line description of the Issue
•	Comment: A more verbose description of the Issue
•	Milestones: A sprint in which the Issue is set to be completed
•	Epics: A product goal that the Issue is associated with (Zenhub feature)
•	Label: A tag that describes the type of Issue (examples: backend,question or bug)
o	Team (Rainbows, Kudos, Unicorns, Nebula, Platform)
o	Focus (Frontend, Backend, UX, Content, etc.)
o	Product (HCA, Identity, Sitewide, etc.)
o	Type (Bug, Testing, Discovery, etc)
•	Assignee: The person that has outstanding work to complete on an Issue
•	Pipelines - are scrum board columns that indicate an Issue's state. Pipelines that we use include:
o	Backlog: Issues that have not been groomed
o	Ice Box: This is the "we'll get around to it" pipeline, where issues go when they've been groomed but aren't ready to be worked on yet. This may be because they're not a high enough priority (e.g. fiddly bug fixes) or they don't have sufficient information
o	Epics: This pipeline hosts Epic Issues which are product goals that consist of multiple smaller Issues
o	Ready: Issues here are ordered by priority (see below) and have enough detail that they can be pulled from at any time
o	Current Sprint: The team has committed to working on the Issues during their present work sprint (1-2 weeks)
o	In Progress: Issues that are actively being worked on
o	Validate (code repositories only): Issues that have PRs ready for review
o	Done: Issues that have been completed and their PRs merged into master For more information on workflow, labels, and Zenhub visit How to File Bugs, Tasks, and Questions
Labeling
Each Issue (a.k.a. work item) is labeled, minimally, with the name of the team it belongs to and the product. This helps product teams discover, triage, and track work.


Github:

You’ll do most of your work from Github. You’ll get some pretty good training, but here are the very basics for when you forget the training the first time you go into a new project (it happens to all of us):
1.	Go to the main Github page. 
2.	On the left about a third of the way down the page, you’ll see a pull-down menu that says, “Branch: master.” Click it
3.	If it’s an existing project, look for the name in the pull-down menu.
4.	If it’s a new project, type in a new project name, starting with Content/WIP/newnameforproject
5.	Hit “enter” on your keyboard
6.	That will take you to a new page in your branch. Usually, you’ll click the “content” folder
7.	Then, you’ll usually click the “pages” folder
8.	Then, depending on which page you’re working on, you’ll click the appropriate folder until you find your page
9.	When you reach the page you need to edit, you’ll see a pencil in the top right corner. Click it.
10.	Go ahead in and make your changes. Don’t be afraid—this is not the main file, and you can make changes until it is merged, which you won’t be doing. 
11.	After your done, scroll to the bottom to “commit changes.”
12.	In the top box, super-briefly describe what you’ve done.
13.	The “commit directly to the…” circle will already be checked. Leave it there.
14.	Hit “commit changes.”
15.	From that point, you’ll be able to look at the github page to make sure there aren’t any obvious problems. 
16.	When you feel you are done editing, scroll to the top of the page. Next to the pull-down menu, you’ll see the link is highlighted. Click “content.”
17.	On the next page, you’ll see on the right “Pull request.” Click it
18.	At the top, you’ll see a description of what you’ve just written in your super-brief description from the page. Edit it to apply to the whole project. So, say it says, “Switched out links.” You could say, “Switching out this link for that link”
19.	On the right, assign yourself and as well as the labels the project is associated with. 
20.	Click the green “create pull request button.”
21.	In the next page, you’ll see a box that says “pending” near a description of the change you just made.
22.	Eventually—after two or three minutes (sometimes longer)—the button will say, “view deployment.”
23.	After you check the page on Heroku (see below) click Peggy as the reviewer to check your work. She’ll take a look, and then she’ll send it to Beth. Beth will either send it to Sophie to merge it, send it back to you for feedback, or send it to you to ask Sophie to merge it. 

Ad Hoc also created a page describing why the project uses GitHub, but also how it’s used in the big picture.
Geek out on Github.

Heroku:

Your next step takes you to the wonderful world of Heroku. So, after you click “view deployment,” you’ll got to what looks like the home screen of Vets.gov, but it’s really just the upside-down. Or staging area. Whatevah. In any case, you can click through to the page you were working on to see how it will look after it’s posted. Always do this. If you see anything screwy, ask somebody. Sophie (@phiden) is great for helping with this, but start with a slack to the content team. They may know the what-for. 





Desperately seeking links:
If you’re working within github, and you’re asked to switch something out—say, we’ve created a new page at Vets.gov, and we need to find all of the pages that link to an external VA.gov page and replace them with the new Vets.gov link—there’s an easy way to look for those links. Anytime! I don't really have a great secret for how to find those links really. In the search bar at the top of github, you can search for the link. If it’s an internal link, you could search for: "/disability-benefits/apply/help/" across the project, for example. 


Heroku:


Workflow















Content Update Request Form Process: 

Because we’ve taken on work that used to be done by the people most familiar with the information we’re posting, we’re careful to make sure we quickly address any changes for content that come in from the experts. These come in through online forms, call Content Update Request Forms. You’ll get an email, and then you’ll have a set process for making the changes. Often, it’s an update: Please change the number of days it takes to process a claim from 107 to 105. We try to get the new information updated within 24 hours.

Check out the Content Update Request Form process.

URL Best Practices

The team worked on SEO guidance, and then experts from Adhoc gave feedback about how to properly write meta descriptions and write a page so that Google likes the pages and ranks them high in searches.

How to create content:

Content process: It used to be that we created content from scratch in a word document, and then there was a bunch of back-and-forth with the subject matter experts (pronounced SME). The full process is here.

That rarely happens now. Usually, we receive a request for an update or to help with the content on a tool, so you’ll start straight in Github.
