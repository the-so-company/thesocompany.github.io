### The Problem
HealthCare.gov is a health insurance exchange website operated under the United States federal government under the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As a critical point-of-entry, website text needed to be written and implemented clearly to maximize readibility and accessibility.

### The Solution

The So Company creates digital content with writers that are both end-user subject matter experts and functional-specific consultants.

For Healthcare.gov, the So Company was hired because the Healthcare.gov team wanted a staff of professional digital content writers, who specialize in rapid agile content development on it's Github framework. Our journalistic-driven process incorporates agile methodologies, which makes the content creation for Healthcare.gov a stable and reliable website for all of its users.
