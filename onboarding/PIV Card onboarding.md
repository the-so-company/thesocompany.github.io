# How to get a PIV card

## Why do I need a PIV card?

The government requires an active PIV (Personal Identification Verification) card for everyone who works on the Vets.gov project. 

Your PIV card will allow physical access to secured areas, such as VA-sponsored laptops and VA buildings, as well as logical access to VA Intranet and email. The card is also to send any PII over the VA network. 

Even those Vets.gov employees that do not need access to VA property must get a PIV. However, you will not be barred from daily work while getting your PIV. 

**The process can take several weeks.**

(Don't give up.)

## Fabulous. How do I get started?

To start the PIV process, please reach out to Matt Pelak (or whomever handles PIV cards for your contract). Matt will send you your paperwork and serve as your PIV sherpa throughout the process. 

1. **First, complete and return all VA PIV paperwork to Neal**. For signatures, please print the document, sign it in pen, scan it, and email it to Matt. (Sorry.) Our COR will not accept digital signatures, phone images of signed documents, etc. So...please print, sign, scan, and email.
2. **Create a New User account at [TMS](www.tms.va.gov), and complete 2 required trainings**. We'll need both the VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness, and the HIPAA Training.  Unfortunately, it's normal to run into a security warning at this stage. It's okay: It's a legitimate federal site. You will need to bypass the security warning to complete registration. (You can do this by clicking "advanced settings" and telling your computer to go on ahead to the site.) 
     - You may want to turn off your pop-up blockers 
     - The preferred browser for the trainings in IE. Mac users will need to be patient and may have to use multiple browsers. 
3. **Send Matt your proof-of-completion certificats**. After you finish your training, you will receive a certificate.  Please save this as a PDF and email it to Matt as proof of completion. Please note that you'll have to complete these trainings every year until the end of time (or, you know, the contract) to keep your PIV active.
4. **Schedule an appointment to get your fingerprints taken**.  
[Check the list of nationwide offices](https://www.oit.va.gov/programs/piv/locations.cfm).  
[Schedule or change your appointment](https://va-piv.com).
5. **Matt will send your paperwork, training documentation and fingerprints to VA**. VA will then submit a link for an eQIP background check within three weeks. If you don't receive a notification saying it has started within three weeks of Neal submitted your stuff, please notify Neal. He'll reach out for an update.
6. **Complete the eQIP application through the link VA emails you**. Please note that the eQIP background check does ask for some extensive information, such as past residence info, references, and the name of your first pet lizard. (Not really on the lizard.) 
     - The form is an electronic version of the Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SP-85P).
     - It will ask you to provide housing, education, travel and work history for the last 7 years, and require you to provide references who can verify that information. 
     - If you are a man born after December 31, 1959, you will need to provide your selective services registration number.  

[Verify your selective service registration number, if necessary](www.sss.gov/Registration/Check-a-Registration/Verification-Form).

7. **Make an appointment to get your PIV card**. After the guv'ment completes your eQUIP, VA will confirm PIV sponsorship. You can then make an appointment to get your PIV card at the same office as you got your fingerprints taken. It may take up to 3 weeks to receive PIV confirmation after submitting the eQIP. Watch for an automated email with “Form 0771” in the subject line. As soon as you receive this email, you are good to pick up your card at any PIV office. Please notify Neal if you have not received any updates after three weeks.
     - Please note that you will still need to pick up your physical card from the VA office of your choice. 
     - Some offices accept walk-ins, others require appointments. It’s best to call your office directly.
     
## How do I renew my PIV card?

Lord. It took a year to get it the first time, and now it's about to expire...

Fortunately, we no longer, as of 4/29/2018, need to update fingerprints every year. (Cuz we don't get new fingers every year...)

However, you still must complete the TMS trainings again, as well as fill in a new application. 

## They'll ask for your TMS account/Project information
