### Copyediting Greatest Hits:
 
>Welcome to the Greatest Hits for this week! I have only one topic this week. I need to write an entry for the style guide about using "they" and "their" as gender neutral pronouns--and whether or not we take this approach on vets.gov. I wanted to share some sources I've found to help inform this decision, so you have a glimpse into my nerdy world. Plus I thought this might be fun to throw out to the group, because many people 
have a strong opinion about this one. Let me know yours! 
 
1) *Grammar Girl* has this:  
[Generic Singular Pronouns Learn when you should use "he," "she," "he/she," and "they."](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/generic-singular-pronouns?page=2)

2) *Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th edition, has this: 

5.227 Gender-neutral singular pronouns 

The only gender-neutral third-person singular personal pronoun in English is *it*, which doesn't refer to humans (with very limited exceptions). Clumsy artifices such as *s/he* and *(wo)man* or artificial genderless pronouns have been tried - for many years - with no success. They won't succeed. And those who use them invite credibility problems. Indefinite pronouns such as *anybody* and *someone* don't always satisfy the need for 
a gender-neutral alternative because they are traditionally regarded as singular antecedents that call for a third-person singular pronoun. Many people substitute the plural *they* and *their* for the singular *he *or *she*. Although *they* and *their* have become common in informal usage, neither is considered acceptable in formal writing, so unless you are given guidelines to the contrary, do not use them in a singular sense. 
 
3) *Garner's Modern American Usage*, third edition, has this: 
 
"It is the most convenient solution to the single biggest problem in sexist language--the generic masculine pronoun. A recent advertisement says, 'Every student can have *their* own computer,' so as to avoid saying *his own computer*..." 
 
The entry notes that it is very common in British English. "And one of the best-edited American papers allows this: 'If the newspaper can't fire him for an ethical breach surely they [read *it*] can fire him for being stupid.'" *Wall Street Journal: 4) *The New Fowler's Modern English Language*, third edition, has this for their entry on *they*, *their*, *them: 
 
"Over the centuries, writers of standing have used they, their, and them with anaphoric reference to a singular pronoun or noun, and the practice has continued in the 20c. to the point that, traditional grammarians aside, such constructions are hardly noticed any more or are not widely felt to lie in a prohibited zone."

### Plain Language: 
 
- The CDC [offers training](http://www.cdc.gov/healthliteracy/gettraining.html) for anyone who would like a certificate in health literacy. 
 
- A Medium writer, Darius Faroux, [recommends seven "great" books](https://medium.com/art-of-practicality/the-7-best-books-ive-ever-read-about-writing-c73324d72edd#.a3gphtv1i) 
about writing, and it looks like a good mix. Mmmm, Zinsser. 
 
### Human-Centered Design: 
 
- We talk a lot about human-centered design at The So Company, as well as some of the government offices in which we work, but what does it mean, exactly? [Customerthink.com writes about](http://customerthink.com/designing-for-growth-how-to-bring-design-thinking-into-your-customer-growth-strategy/) 
the basics of HCD, as well as how to incorporate it internally. As an example, everyone assumes older Veterans aren't into emails or websites. As it turns out, that's not true. How do we know that? The Veterans Experience office asked them, rather than taking conventional wisdom as truth. 
 
- And the [Boston Globe reports](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/10/28/designers-bring-private-sector-ideas-public-policy/oQS7HSvcSmEhUpN9gJ6QqM/story.html) 
on what HCD looks like out in the field by focusing on a team that went out with first responders to look at all the pieces of their days and see how they could better fit together. This makes sense because each responder knows his or her own piece, but probably no one has looked at the whole of it before. 
 
- The [Institute for Human Centered Design is using](https://cre.nerej.com/institute-human-centered-design-launching-two-new-initiatives/) 
the method to look into better accessibility for aging populations and people with behavioral health and substance-use issues. 
 
### Open Data: 
 
- Officials say there's enough food for everyone, yet people still go to bed hungry. There may be an open-data gap that prevents more efficient food use, [reports Fastcoexist.com](https://www.fastcoexist.com/3065024/how-a-lack-of-open-data-is-slowing-a-farming-revolution). 
 
### Open Government: 
 
- Pittsburgh just launched "Burgh's Eye View," which documents everything 
from potholes to noise violations, and it's also open-source, [reports Trib 
Live](http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/11397515-74/app-burgh-eye). 
 
### Vet Politics:

- IAVA sold $250,000 sponsorship tickets to a forum they hosted for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, [reports Military.com's Amy Bushatz](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/10/31/veterans-group-sold-250k-sponsorship-to-presidential-forum.html?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEarly%20Bird%20Brief%2011.01.2016&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). 
 
### Vet Love: 
 
- [Military Times has released](http://www.militarytimes.com/bestforvets-colleges2017?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEarly%20Bird%20Brief%2011.01.2016&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief) 
its annual "best schools for Vets" list. 
 
### Government contracts: 
 
- NASA is [looking for a writer](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&tab=core&id=6c36c57398359f94da3bd27ab0ea789a)
