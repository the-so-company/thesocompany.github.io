### Copyediting Greatest Hits:

>Greatest Hits this week focuses on new additions to the style guide that
came out of Communicate Health's plain-language suggestions.

1) numbers: Use numerals for all numbers. Do not spell out any numbers.

  * This one goes against Chicago Manual of Style, which advises spelling out
numbers zero through one hundred or, alternately, zero through nine. When
we go back through existing site content to apply our new plain-language
standards, we will have to address this.

2) Here are 4 words added to the "Words to avoid" list:

  * modify: Instead try "change"

  * notify: Instead try "tell"

  * designate: Instead try "choose" or "assign"

  * determine: Instead try "figure out" or "decide"

3) These 3 additions are words that we've used consistently since the
beginning of vets.gov. We need to discuss whether there are plain-language
alternatives sufficient to our needs:

  * eligible: Communicate Health (CH) suggests "able to," "allowed to," "can"

  * enroll: CH suggests "sign up"

  * compensation (use sparingly): CH says, whenever possible, choose more
specific language, like "monthly payment".

### Plain Language:

- Lawyers filed a class-action lawsuit against Georgia this week because a
proposed constitutional amendment is so poorly written that voters won't be
able to understand it, [reports 
WABE](http://news.wabe.org/post/why-wordy-ballot-language-may-leave-ga-voters-puzzled).
The language? "Shall the Constitution of Georgia be amended to allow the
state to intervene in chronically failing public schools in order to
improve student performance?"

- [This road sign](https://wordstodeeds.com/2016/09/26/monday-smile-road-sign-as-clear-as-mud/), from the "From Words to Deeds" blog, is a good example of why we need plain-language writers.

### Open Data:

- Beyond sharing research information to ensure scientists can create
cures faster, [Health Affairs reports](http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/09/20/the-culture-of-data-sharing-has-to-change/) that sharing data about payment programs and outcomes from health systems can also improve care across the board - as well as creating business opportunities.

- The White House has formed a partnership to use open data to fight climate change, 
[reports MeriTalk](https://www.meritalk.com/articles/white-house-supports-partnership-on-climate-data-sharing/).

- It is also expanding plans to improve access to contracting, foreign aid
and aid development data, [reports fedscoop](http://fedscoop.com/white-house-expanding-open-data-commitments).

### Open Government:

- [The Sunlight Foundation has announced](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/09/sunlight-sunset/501071/)...something. It seems they have not hired a new director or defined a continuing purpose for themselves, so as the world sways with the weight of data breaches from Russia even as U.S. presidential candidates refuse to give up basic data, a group known for holding politicians accountable has an unsure future.

- Wednesday is International Right to Know Day, which celebrates individuals' rights to government information, [reports NSW Government](http://data.nsw.gov.au/blog/right-know-week-2016).

- Last year, Ajay Kumar filed a request for information (similar to a FOIA
request) asking the government of India if it was prepared for a zombie
attack, [reports firstpost.com](http://www.firstpost.com/living/why-i-filed-an-rti-query-about-our-governments-preparedness-for-a-zombie-invasion-3017624.html). His goal, he writes, was to protest several issues within his government, but the resulting [post](http://www.firstpost.com/india/heres-an-important-question-for-the-govt-is-it-equipped-to-handle-zombie-apocalypse-3012424.html) went viral.

### Vet Tech:

- SecDef Ash Carter is trying to convince the tech community that they
should help with his push to bring the Pentagon into the 21st Century, [reports
Breaking Defense](http://breakingdefense.com/2016/09/ash-carter-wants-you-for-the-defense-digital-service/?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%209-15-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

### Job Search:

- The FDA [is looking for a technical editor](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/451105800) who can read through and write government documents in plain language.

### Vet Love:

- The Justice Department has bolstered many local Veterans' court projects
with a $4 million boost last week, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/justice-department-reaches-out-to-veterans?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%209-21-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). The courts keep thousands of Vets out of jail by addressing underlying
mental health concerns and monitoring progress instead of locking them up.

- [Reveal went back to the Veterans Affairs](https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/no-choice-failing-americas-veterans/) scandals of two years ago, and then investigated what VA did as a follow-up to the problem. The solutions were sometimes as bad as the original problems, they found: Hospitals blamed the whistleblowers; across-the-board
"fixes" didn't take into account local systems that worked; and troubled medical departments were downsized, rather than improved.

### What we're reading:

- Sometimes - in the midst of writing about, say, insurance policies, or
coding, say, a map for a bunch of offices - a boost of creativity can be just
the kick that helps the rest of the afternoon fly by. Larry Kim, the founder of Wordstream, [lists out several usable](https://medium.com/the-mission/ways-to-become-more-creative-in-the-next-10-minutes-fef1e48a0b5f#), easy ways to do just that - such as taking a moment to doodle or reading flash fiction.
