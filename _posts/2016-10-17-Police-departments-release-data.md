### Copyediting Greatest Hits:

>For Greatest Hits this week, we present to you our new DSVA-approved style guide entry for linking conventions (below), as well as a link to the new location of the style guide:

[http://bit.ly/vets-gov-style-guide](http://bit.ly/vets-gov-style-guide)

#### Linking Conventions

Use both embedded links and links set apart from text as is appropriate for each page. When possible, place links outside running text, either at the end of a paragraph or on a separate line following the paragraph. However, it is ok to embed links when we want to encourage the user to browse to find a link to a deeper page.

* Use descriptive and actionable words and phrases that tell users where the link will take them. Don't use the following non-informative, general link phrases:

    + Click here

    + Learn more

    + See more

    + Read more

It may make sense to start a link phrase with these words if the rest of the phrase is specific and descriptive. But you can often do without these overused words altogether by using more specific verbs or starting with key words. Above all, be sure your users know what to expect (where they will land) when they click.

* Pay attention to link length. Make the link long enough that it's easy to click on. Don't make it so long that the relevant words are lost among the less important words.

+ 5-8 words for embedded links. Don't link entire sentences in running text.

+ Entire sentences or phrases when the link is set apart from the running text, either by placing it at the end of a paragraph or by inserting a space between the running text and the link.

* Don't link ending punctuation. You don't want the period to be underlined. If a string of words at the end of a sentence is linked, use punctuation (usually a period) as grammar would dictate, but don't link it.

### Plain Language:

- John McIntyre, of the Baltimore Sun, has an opinion about "s/he" and "he/she" and the idea of a gender-neutral "they." He [shares it by video](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/language-blog/87915039-132.html).

- And just as we're talking about the need for plain-language forms at Veterans Affairs, the [Center for Plain Language came out with a report card](http://centerforplainlanguage.org/federal-plain-language-report-card/) for government forms. They're looking at "high burden" forms and will release the results in January.

### Human-Centered Design:

- Companies ahead in digital transformation have four things in common, including a focus on human-centered design, [reports CIO](http://www.cio.com/article/3131322/leadership-management/how-to-thrive-in-a-digital-world-part-2.html). And that's tough because it's not traditionally how companies think about problems.

- Midcentury design, the original mass-produced and inoffensive furnishings, may be sticking around longer than other trends because it suits our need for simple sameness - which makes it the "pumpkin-spice latte" of interior design, [reports Fastcodesign.com](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3064284/mid-century-modern-is-the-pumpkin-spice-latte-of-interior-design). First Oreos and butter, and now your couch.

- Planned Parenthood has, for decades used bold graphics and eye-catching fonts to gain an audience, [reports Fastcodesign.com](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3064658/in-pictures-100-years-of-design-at-planned-parenthood). Apparently, it is not the pumpkin spice latte of women's issues.

### Open Data:

- Taking open data to a different level, Better Block offers a series of printable plans for outdoor furniture so communities can build park benches, trash cans or even outdoor cafes using plywood, [reports CityLab](http://www.citylab.com/navigator/2016/10/better-block-open-source-printing-street-furniture/503765/).

- Justice Lab has just released a county-by-county breakdown of how many guns and what kind of guns have been bought in California over the last decade, [reports SCVTV](http://scvnews.com/2016/10/12/ag-releases-firearm-sales-data-on-openjustice/). The site was launched by the state's attorney general.

### Open Government:

- The U.S. government just released open-source code for anyone who would like to help in the American poverty crisis. The code helps people determine their eligibility for income-based government-assistance programs, such as food stamps, [reports Business Wire](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161013006185/en/HHS-Intuit-Release-App-Fight-Poverty-Nationwide).

- Police departments across the country will publish data sets as part of a White-House initiative to create transparency in law enforcement, [reports the Lebanon Democrat](http://www.lebanondemocrat.com/Law-Enforcement/2016/10/13/Mt-Juliet-police-to-participate-in-White-House-led-police-data-initiative). The President announced the Police Data Initiative Thursday.

### Vet Love:

- The Defense Department has delayed roll-out of its new electronic health records system, but says that won't affect its ability to interact with VA health records, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/mhs-genesis-delayed-feb-2017?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEarly%20Bird%20Brief%2010.12.2016&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). (@leoshane)

- A VA facility in San Antonios is taking heat because it doesn't have a waiting area with chairs, [reports KSAT](http://www.ksat.com/news/defenders/vets-forced-to-wait-in-the-heat-stand-for-long-periods-of-time-at-san-antonio-va-clinic?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMil%20EBB%2010.13.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). Veterans stand or lean against a wall while they wait for their
appointments.

### Vet Politics:

- A retired two-star general believes Congress could get some things done, rather than bickering and refusing compromise, if more Veterans were elected to office, [reports DOD Buzz](http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/10/13/wanted-veterans-congress-break-gridlock/?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMil%20EBB%2010.14.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). His reasoning? Veterans know how to play well with others.

- A new Got Your Six campaign asks people to thank a Veteran by voting, [reports
Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/gotyou6-psa-vote-veterans?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEarly%20Bird%20Brief%2010.17.2016&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

### What we're reading:

- When a Pinterest employee realized there were no good numbers showing how many women worked at tech-industry companies, she invited employees of those companies to count them, 
[reports Backchannel](https://backchannel.com/this-twenty-something-forced-silicon-valley-to-show-her-the-numbers-2cddca7b9d3b#.xp5lkxwwm). Within a week, employees for 50 companies did just that.

- "Burst inspirationist" [Kayla Minguez researches](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-music-affects-your-brain-plus-11-artists-to-listen-to-at-work-4f0a5081d9e9#.hq6iy3tw2) whether music can improve your work, decides it can, and provides a playlist at Medium.

- As troops head back into Mosul, they're taking big data and apps with them, [reports Defense One in "The Apps They Carried](http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/10/apps-they-carried-software-big-data-and-fight-mosul/132409/?oref=3Dd-river&&&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief)."
