### Plain Language:

- Carlos Lopez, a college student in Virginia, [writes for The Cavalier
Daily](http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2016/11/lopez-virginia-should-end-ballot-confusion) that ballots need to be written in plain language because 43 percent of Americans "read at basic or below basic levels." Interestingly, the first comment states that people who want to vote should better educate
themselves. All sorts of issues wrapped up in this one...

### Human-Centered Design:

- Is human-centered design real or just a buzzword? [Devex explains the
concept](https://www.devex.com/news/what-is-human-centered-design-and-why-does-it-matter-89185).

- And the [School of Visual Arts - Design for Social Innovation is using](http://3blmedia.com/News/Measured-Summit-Measuring-Impact-Social-Design-Human-Health) existing research (don't laugh) to see if HCD is effective.

### Open Government:

- The University of Waterloo created a goose-tracking map using open data to help students avoid being attacked, [reports The Verge's Lizzie Plaugic](http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13677516/goose-watch-geese-tracking-app-university-of-waterloo). Feathers. Ruffled.

- And, as Government Techology's [Jennifer Angarita reports](http://www.govtech.com/data/3-Key-Strategies-for-Unlocking-Potential-of-Open-Data-Through-Community-Engagement.html),
that may be a pretty good example of engaging the community with a solution that addresses a daily issue. She offers three strategies for gaining community engagement through open data.

### Contracting:

- The General Services Adminstration is building a platform to help government agencies write contracts, [reports fedscoop's Billy Mitchell](http://fedscoop.com/gsa-building-cloud-based-contract-writing-service).

- And IT contracting will increase in the next couple of months, but will likely slow down at the beginning of the year, [reports FCW's Mark Rockwell](https://fcw.com/articles/2016/11/16/contracting-forecast-2017.aspx).

### What we're reading:

- [Screenwriter Julie Bush wondered](https://medium.com/adventures-in-the-peen-trade/bad-artists-bb8dbbde2f87#.bgqv7x4ua) why 53 percent of women voted for Donald Trump, and she determined that Hollywood, the perceived land of liberals, might be part of the problem.

- On politics news overload? Feel like you need to do something, be better-informed, take on the world? Thomas Oppong of alltopstartups lists 62 websites to help you do just that.

- Because it's so easy to miss typos and errors, such as "Obama bil

read to be entertained, [writes Lexion Capital CEO Elle Kaplan in Medium](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-use-the-reading-habits-of-billionaires-to-radically-improve-your-intelligence-and-success-9c24647e2b59#.f101mdtsk).
(Of course, [other studies have shown](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/) people who read fiction have more empathy. Decisions, decisions...)
