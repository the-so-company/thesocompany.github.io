### Plain Language:

- Writing in Canadian newspaper The Daily Courier, [David Bond makes a case](http://www.kelownadailycourier.ca/opinion/article_c6d506d0-e74e-11e6-8b8b-bf00ea1f600c.html) for applying plain language guidelines to "alternative facts" and "fake news."
 
- Meanwhile, Chief Nursing Officer of the Odessa Regional Medical Center, [Levi Stone reminds ](http://www.oaoa.com/people/health/levi_stone/article_c5edc8a6-e6a4-11e6-bb2b-4b49ea21afb5.html) health professionals to use plain language and avoid medical jargon when discussing healthcare options with their patients. He says patients should ask more questions, seek more clear answers, and keep records.

### Open Data:

- The primary goal of the "Data-to-Decisions" program, according to Capt. Brenton Byrd-Fulbright, program manager, is to get data quickly to the people who need it. [C4Risrnet looks at](http://www.c4isrnet.com/articles/air-force-wants-data-to-reach-decision-makers-more-rapidly) some of the Air Force's cloud-based solutions to closing the communication gaps.

- What do the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Justice Statistics have in common? They're three of the 100 statistical agencies vulnerable to having their budgets slashed by the new administration, [says Forbes magazine.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2017/01/30/vital-information-from-more-than-100-federal-statistical-agencies-may-be-at-risk) If it happens, it would mean less access to the data we need to make decisions about the world we live in.

- Speaking for the Sunlight Foundation, [Alexander Howard told](https://technical.ly/dc/2017/01/30/heres-whats-up-at-sunlight-foundation/) Technical.ly that rather than shutting its doors as previously hinted, the non-profit will continue its open-data advocacy work under new leadership.

### Open Government:

- Participating in social media and maintaining a website are not the same thing as being transparent, 
[writes Jason Allison](http://www.statetechmagazine.com/article/2017/01/transparency-requires-government-data-be-available-discoverable-and-accessible) in StateTech magazine. He says balancing the tension between privacy and transparency is possible, but it's not the IT department's job to define the boundaries.

- As its name suggests, "crowdlaw," is crowd-sourced lawmaking. Because this meld of collaborative policy and open data is performing so well, the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2017/01/30/tracking-collaborative-policy-for-open-data/) has created a Google doc spreadsheet to track and inspire similar efforts.

### Civic Tech:

- [Jane Wiseman observes](http://www.govtech.com/people/A-Roadmap-for-Chief-Data-Officers.html) in GovTech that the most effective Chief Data Officers, "...are not just technically good; they are good at reading people, at knowing when to push and when to back off." Her white paper describes a roadmap to follow for new CDOs developing their positions.

### Vet Politics:

- [Military Times reports](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/what-percentage-of-federal-workers-are-veterans) that Veteran Affairs released a list of positions that will be unaffected by the government's hiring freeze.

- Relatives of Iraqi interpreters will be able to emigrate to the United States after all, [reports The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/middleeast/trump-visa-ban-iraq-interpreters.html).

### Vet Love:
- L. reuteri makes colicky babies feel better. However, inspired by a related study on mice, VA researchers want to see if it can help 40 vets with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, [reports Military Times.](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/va-is-studying-gut-bacteria-in-ptsd-tbi-patients-following-success-in-mice)

- Improving care for veterans at VA hospitals may be harder than it looks. Among other challenges, [NPR says](http://www.npr.org/2017/01/31/512052311/va-hospitals-still-struggling-with-adding-staff-despite-billions-from-choice-act) candidates to staff VA hospitals want to work there, but the onboarding process takes so much time that many candidates drop out before their first day of work. 

### Human-Centered Design

- How do you build a customer-focused IT team? [The Enterprisers Project makes a case](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2017/2/humana-cio-shares-3-essential-skills-building-customer-focused-it-team) for applying human-centered design, agile methodology, and data analytics to improving customer experience.

- The Office of Personnel Management is offering a class on human-centered design. [Sign up](https://lab.opm.gov/class-sign-up) for the monthly, three-day workshop.

### What we're reading:

- [Mark Humphries teases](https://medium.com/the-spike/wired-for-memory-how-your-brain-remembers-by-completing-patterns-ad2c6d7bff89#.rsai5nwk1) apart the science of the neurological connections behind pattern recognition and memories for non-neurophysiologists. Or so I remember.
