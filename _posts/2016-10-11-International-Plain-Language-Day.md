### Copyediting Greatest Hits:

>October 13 is [International Plain Language Day!](http://www.iplainday.org/) Break out the bubbly!

Welcome to this week's Greatest Hits of recent copyediting and
plain-language edits and additions to the vets.gov style guide.

1) Here's a recent example of passive voice that we changed to active:

*Passive*: Your information will be kept private at all times.

(We know it is passive because of what's missing: Who's keeping your
information private?)

*Active*: We will keep your information private at all times.

2) Danielle tipped us off to a low-literacy guideline for word choice that I'll be adding to the style guide that has to do with the number of syllables in a word. CDC's "Simply Put: A Guide for Creating Easy-to-Understand Materials" says, "Use words with 1-2 two syllables when you can." Danielle and I were thinking that our vets.gov rule would say
something like: "Use 1 and 2 syllable words when you can, 3 if needed, and 4 only when there's no other alternative." It'll be a general guideline. This topic came up because we were using the words "participate" and "participation" in some text. That's too many syllables!

3) Here's an example of a sentence I rewrote to make our tone more conversational:

*Before*: To confirm enrollment hours, you may call 1-866-441-6075.

*After*: Call first to make sure it's open when you want to come in:
1-866-441-6075.

Have a great week, everyone!

### Plain Language:

- As health companies, inspired both by the Plain Writing Act and the Affordable Care Act, work to write materials that customers understand, [O'Dwyer's Joel Machak explains](http://www.odwyerpr.com/story/public/7678/2016-10-06/quest-for-health-literacy.html) "plain language" means more than "short sentences."

### Human-Centered Design:

- Tulane University is the 40th facility to create a Design for America studio, and its students will soon begin using human-centered design to create positive change in their communities, [the university reports](http://news.tulane.edu/news/problem-solving-through-design).

- And, [Technical.ly reflects on](http://technical.ly/dc/2016/10/07/white-house-open-data-innovation-summit/) the good and bad at the White House Open Data Summit. Curing cancer? Good. Having to consider suing the White House to gain information? Bad.

And are they committed to more open-data processes within the government?

- [U.S. Chief Data Scientist DJ Patil tells Nextgov](http://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2016/10/how-publicly-posting-data-can-cut-through-red-tape/132168/)
the federal government is at the early stages of open data, but that posting data sets will help people cut through red tape.

- California just built the first state data portal built on open source, [reports
statescoop](http://statescoop.com/california-becomes-first-state-to-launch-open-source-open-data-portal).


### Vet Love:

- Veterans continue to beg the government for help diagnosing and treating illnesses the Vets believe should be service-connected to open burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan that consumed as much as 240 tons of trash a day, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/burn-pits-obama-letter?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMil%20EBB%2010.7.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

John McCain, R-Arizona, has agreed to drop a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act that would have limited Veterans preference to a one-time use, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/mccain-veterans-hiring-preference-ndaa?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMil%20EBB%2010.7.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

- After Veterans who made calls to Veterans Affairs' suicide hotline were sent to voicemail, lawmakers are demanding proof that steps have been taken to fix the problem, [reports The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/299410-lawmakers-push-va-on-fixes-to-veterans-suicide-hotline?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEBB%2010.6.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

### What we're reading:

- Women are more than twice as likely to quit the tech industry as men, and [Rachel Thomas writes at Medium](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/the-real-reason-women-quit-tech-and-how-to-address-it-6dfb606929fd#.5pv2ps300) that it's because even companies that pride themselves on diversity may not provide women with the same opportunities.

- Some habits help you build time for yourself or can lead you to be more successful; others just keep you from being ridiculously annoying. [Travis Bradberry, coauthor of Emotional Intelligence: 2.0, recommends](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bad-habits-you-must-eliminate-from-your-daily-routine-bradberry) not keeping the phone in the bedroom, but also putting the phone away while you're talking to other people. Beyond being rude, it pulls your focus away from the conversation. Also, don't think about toxic people.
